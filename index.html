    <p class="container"> I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at California State University, San Bernardino, with an expected graduation date of December 2025 and a GPA of 3.674. My educational journey has provided me with a solid foundation in key areas such as data structures, algorithms, web development, database management, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. Through my coursework and personal projects, I have gained hands-on coding experience, particularly in building web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrating APIs such as the PokeAPI to develop interactive applications like my Kanto, Jhoto, and Hoenn Pokedex projects. Additionally, I have worked with databases like MongoDB and explored AI-driven solutions. After graduation, I aim to secure a role in the tech industry where I can continue expanding my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and explore areas such as front-end development, software engineering, or artificial intelligence.</p>
